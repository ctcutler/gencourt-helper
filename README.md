This is a wrapper around various pages on the New Hampshire state legislature's web site (https://gc.nh.gov/) that makes it easier to:
- link directly to a bill
- discover when a bill is scheduled for public hearing
- navigate to the form where people can indicate their position on a bill and leave comments
